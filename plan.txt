Weather Dashboard:
The plan:
step-by-step approach to tackle this project:

1. **Project Understanding and Planning**
   - Understand the project requirements thoroughly.
   - Draw a rough sketch or wireframe of the final dashboard design.
   - List down all the features and functionalities you need to implement.

2. **Set Up Basic Project Structure**
   - Set up a new project directory with all the necessary files. This should include at least an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file.
   - Implement basic HTML structure and add links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
   - Add a form input to the HTML where users can enter the name of a city.

3. **API Key Registration and Testing**
   - Register for an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Remember, you might need to wait a couple of hours before it gets activated.
   - Once activated, test the API key by making a simple request to confirm it's working correctly.

4. **Implementing Current Weather Feature**
   - Write a function in JavaScript to get the current weather data for a city using the API. This function should take the city name from the form input, use it to make a request to the API, and then display the received data on the dashboard. This data should include the city name, date, weather conditions icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

5. **Implementing Future Weather Feature**
   - Write another function to get the 5-day weather forecast for the entered city. This function should make a request to the API and display the received data on the dashboard. Each day's forecast should include the date, weather conditions icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

6. **Implementing Search History Feature**
   - Every time a user searches for a city, save that city name in the local storage.
   - Display a list of searched cities on the dashboard. This list should be retrieved from the local storage.
   - Add a click event to each city in the search history. When clicked, it should display the current and future weather conditions for that city.

7. **Styling the Dashboard**
   - Use CSS to style the dashboard according to your preference. Make sure the layout is clean and the data is easy to read.

8. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Thoroughly test all the features and functionalities of your weather dashboard to ensure everything is working as expected.
   - Fix any bugs or issues that you come across during testing.

9. **Documentation and Deployment**
   - Write a comprehensive README file explaining how to use the dashboard and how it was built.
   - Deploy the dashboard on a suitable platform.




Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the 5 Day Weather ForecastLinks to an external site. to retrieve weather data for cities. The base URL should look like the following: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}. After registering for a new API key, you may need to wait up to 2 hours for that API key to activate.

HINT
You will use localStorage to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keysLinks to an external site..

User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
